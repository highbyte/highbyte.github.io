# Welcome
Hi! My name is Christer, and this is my personal home page.

## Now
Currently working as a consultant at [Ecrucial][ecrucial] in Stockholm, Sweden, doing mostly DevOps, development, and application architecture work in the .NET space. I've started some [open source projects][github_user] on GitHub. Other IT related interests include [home automation][home_automation] and gaming. 

## Earlier
Been coding and doing other development/IT-related stuff professionally since 1995, using a bunch of different technologies.

## Even earlier
I wrote my first simple programs back in the 80â€™s on a [ZX81][zx81] in Basic, and later on more complex ones on C128 and Amiga in Assembler where I was involved in the [Demoscene][demoscene]. Started using the alias [Highbyte][highbyte_demoscene] around then.
